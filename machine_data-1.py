machine_data contains raw data of a part from 3 manufactures A, B, C
The system is run to failure under load
The load and the operation time is provided in each row

What is the range of load and time during operation for each manufacturer?
What is the most expected load value?
How are the load and time related?
Which distribution best describes the load?
Which distribution best describes the time?

Which manufacturer has the best performance and why?
